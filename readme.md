# Minesweeper Font
This project is for my Honors 390 Math and Art Final. This project takes the old school game Minesweeper and allows the player to select a custom map based on a letter. This combines the mathematical logic of Minesweeper with the art of typography.

I started with an open source version of Minesweeper, and modified it to create the custom maps. Appreciation and credit for the base game goes to nickarocho on Github
